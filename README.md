# rEMT
This package implements methods to analyze and control of Boolean networks.

This code was originally written by Namhee Kim, and has been developed with the help of many others.

**Reference:**


## 1. Requirements

**Developed using Python 3.7**  

**Some packages must be installed:**  
    pyboolnet <https://github.com/hklarner/pyboolnet>  
    Networkx  
    NumPy  
    Pandas  
    Matplotlib  


## 2. Implementation

+ Import networks in BoolNet format (in the `network` directory)
+ A simple toy network example is provided.  

+ 1_Attractor simulation.ipynb : attractor simulation of Boolean network model  
+ 2_Molecular state ambiguity.ipynb : network dynamic analysis using the concept of frustration  


## 3. Notes

+ All outputs are already provided in the `result` directory.  
+ To reproduce our main results, please run codes in the `addditional_code` directory.  
+ Some results can be obtained after adjusting some variables from the above codes.
